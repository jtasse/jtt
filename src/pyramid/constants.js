export const bioText = `I am a Certified Professional Technical Communicator and software developer who has created technical documentation since 2007.

At least since I was assembling PCs in high school (and probably earlier), I have had a love of tech. I took the long way around by majoring in Philosophy in college, but after a few years I realized that I wanted to work with software. And I did just that at Hyland Software–going from implementer to QA to developer.

But a common thread throughout all this work was that I found I was particularly good at documenting the software for different stakeholders–developers, end users, tech support, product owners, etc. In fact, while I would say that while I am good at writing code, I am even better at writing in English!`
