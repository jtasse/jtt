<p>
	I am a Certified Professional Technical Communicator and software developer
	who has created technical documentation since 2007.
</p>
<p>
	At least since I was assembling PCs in high school (and probably earlier), I
	have had a love of tech. I took the long way around by majoring in Philosophy
	in college, but after a few years I realized that I wanted to work with
	software. And I did just that at Hyland Software–going from implementer to QA
	to developer.
</p>
<p>
	But a common thread throughout all this work was that I found I was
	particularly good at documenting the software for different
	stakeholders–developers, end users, tech support, product owners, etc. In
	fact, while I would say that while I am good at writing code, I am even better
	at writing in English!
