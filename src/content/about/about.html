<h1>Bio</h1>
<p>
	I am a Certified Professional Technical Communicator and software developer
	who has created technical documentation since 2007.
</p>
<p>
	At least since I was assembling PCs in high school (and probably earlier), I
	have had a love of tech. I took the long way around by majoring in philosophy
	in college, but after a few years I realized that I wanted to work with
	software. And I did just that at Hyland Software—going from implementer to QA
	to developer.
</p>
<p>
	But a common thread throughout all this work was that I found I was
	particularly good at documenting the software for different
	stakeholders—developers, end users, tech support, product owners, etc. In
	fact, while I would say that while I am good at writing code, I am even better
	at writing in English.

<h1>About this site</h1>
<p>
	I built this iteration of jamestasse.tech with a lot of help from Claude Code
	and Gemini Code Assist. For my own amusement (and maybe yours), I have
	preserved the earlier (WordPress) iteration of the site at (TODO)
	jamestasse.tech/old.
