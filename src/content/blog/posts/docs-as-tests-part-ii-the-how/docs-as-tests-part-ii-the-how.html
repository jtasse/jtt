						My last post was very much focused on the business value of Docs as
						Tests and [hopefully] building some excitement in the minds of
						technical writers. But in this one my goal is to provide enough
						technical detail to whet the appetite of more technical folks (think
						developers, DocOps, etc.) while still bringing along those of you
						tech writers (or documentarians, if you prefer) that dared to dream
						after seeing the demo from last time.
					</p>
					<section>
						<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>
						<p>
							By the way, it's important I acknowledge that some documentarians
							write code and some software engineers write docs—I will do my
							best to meet you where you are!
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="technical-approach">Technical Approach</h2>
						<p>
							I fully admit that trying to create an instructional technical
							post for such a diverse set of readers is a bit like threading a
							needle, but I am going to try anyway. So I'll start with some
							suggestions as you read this post:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								For folks with less technical experience: this might feel a bit
								like onboarding at your last job (but hopefully more fun!), as I
								am going to introduce you to the tools, commands, etc. that
								you'll need to run the demo from the
								<a href="/blog/posts/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level"
									>last post</a
								>
								(and more) yourself.
							</li>
							<li>
								For folks with more technical experience: I'll try to structure
								things so you can easily skip over sections you might already
								know (for example - installing VS Code).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="goals-for-this-post">Goals for this post</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Discuss where the testing we're doing fits with automated
								software tests
							</li>
							<li>Install prerequisites</li>
							<li>Run tests</li>
						</ol>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="where-are-we">Where Are We?</h2>
						<p>
							Before getting into the technical stuff I want to paint a picture
							of where Docs as Tests lives in the software development and
							documentation space. If you have any familiarity with Continuous
							Integration / Continuous Delivery (or
							<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/">CI/CD</a>),
							you've probably seen a diagram like the one below.
						</p>

								alt="CI/CD Diagram"

						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a></li>
							<li>
								<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a>
							</li>
							<li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							I can vouch for Node.js major version 22 working fine with the
							tools we will use in these tests.
						</p>
						<h3>Code</h3>
						<p>Clone the companion repo:</p>
						<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/jtasse/docsastests-demo.git</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="running-the-tests">Running the tests</h2>
						<h3>UI Test (Doc Detective)</h3>
						<p>
							In this test we're going to use Doc Detective to run the test
							described in the demo portion of the previous blog post. After
							confirming that the test fails, we're going to make the required
							change in our docs and run the tests again to verify the issue is
							resolved.
						</p>
						<p>Start the product server:</p>
						<pre><code>node server.js</code></pre>
						<p>Then run the Doc Detective test:</p>
						<pre><code>npx doc-detective --input readthedocs/docs/source/account-setup.md</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="making-and-verifying-the-fix">
							Making &amp; Verifying the Fix
						</h2>
						<p>
							If Doc Detective finds a mismatch (for example the button text
							changed from "Create Account" to "Sign Up") then update the docs
							and run the test again. The post walks through a sample fix and
							confirms the tests pass thereafter.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="api-test">API Test (markdown-doctest)</h2>
						<p>
							This section demonstrates using
							<a href="https://github.com/Widdershin/markdown-doctest"
								>markdown-doctest</a
							>
							to validate code snippets. The post includes an example where a
							typo in a URL (`todoz` vs `todos`) produces a failing test, and
							shows how fixing the snippet resolves the failure.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
						<p>
							Since you've now tested a UI and API using different tools, you
							can officially say you have Docs as Tests experience in those
							areas. Follow me on
							<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtasse/">LinkedIn</a> if
							you'd like to be notified when I publish a video or another blog
							post.
