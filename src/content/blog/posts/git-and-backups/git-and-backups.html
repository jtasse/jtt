					<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

					<p>
						Lately I've been working on some projects—including a complete
						reimagining of this very website—and as such I've been interacting
						with Git on a daily basis. At some point I ran into some conflicts
						(let's call it <em>infighting</em>) between various code assistants
						(*glares at Copilot*) and the recurrence of some workspace troubles
						that I have encountered over the years. So I decided that a backup
						solution more robust than the
						<em>copy appropriate code folders to backup folder</em> approach
						I've been doing for years was needed.
					</p>

					<p>
						On a related note, since I pivoted to technical writing full time in
						2024, I've encountered a lot of folks that have been writing for
						years but have either been forced into the Docs as Code approach, or
						just want to get more comfortable with it. I get you, and I think I
						can help.
					</p>

					<h2 id="gitting-gud">Gitting Gud</h2>

					<p>OK, sorry for the pun, but it's actually relevant here.</p>

					<p>
						Before I get into the specifics of the backup solution, I wanted to
						address the elephant in the room:
						<strong
							>yes, if you're comfortable with the redundancy that git provides
							when backing up your [pushed] code, then you don't need an
							additional backup solution!</strong
						>
					</p>

					<p>
						To put that into technical terms, if you're doing something like
						this...
					</p>

					<pre><code>git add .
git push origin main</code></pre>

					<p>
						...then you've just backed up any tracked files to a remote
						repository. Sweet!
					</p>

					<p>
						But. <em>But</em>—and this is where things get messy—there's a lot
						that can happen before you push.
					</p>

					<p>
						I mentioned coding assistants above, and I'll pick on GitHub Copilot
						(a tool co-developed by OpenAI and Microsoft subsidiary GitHub)
						here. Copilot seems to take a different approach to other coding
						assistants that I've tried. I confess I don't entirely understand
						the differences, but according to ChatGPT (lol):
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							"The short version:
							<strong
								>Copilot operates <em>inside</em> the editor's text
								model</strong
							>, while tools like Claude Code and Gemini tend to operate
							<em>around</em> it. That difference makes Copilot uniquely capable
							of introducing destructive conflicts when you accept or reject
							suggestions."
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Furthermore, Copilot can make edits even "before you explicitly
						accept them" (!).
					</p>

					<p>
						This alone might be reason enough to look for a local code backup
						solution, but I'll list a few more:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							You want to push "meaty" commits that contain a full feature,
							bugfix, etc. rather than lots of little commits (see also:
							squashing commits is a pain :p)
						</li>
						<li>
							You don't know what you don't know, and just want the comfort of
							being able to manually revert files if something gets borked
						</li>
						<li>You're rebasing commits (and not fully comfortable with it)</li>
					</ul>

					<h2 id="existing-local-backup-solutions">
						Existing Local Backup Solutions
					</h2>

					<p>
						It's worth noting that there are lots of existing backup tools out
						there. (I, for one, used the free version of
						<a href="http://fbackup.com">FBackup</a> for years). Although I
						think the propagation of free cloud backup services like Google
						Drive and Microsoft OneDrive have obviated the need for a lot of
						folks to run local backups; if you already use a local backup
						utility then this solution may be overkill.
					</p>

					<h2 id="this-backup-solution">This Backup Solution</h2>

					<p>
						OK, I think we're finally past the caveats. The particulars of my
						backup solution (I call it "ReactiveBackup") can be found at
						<a href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup"
							>https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup</a
						>
						and its
						<a
							href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/blob/main/README.md"
							>README</a
						>
						file.
					</p>

					<p>But here's a quick primer:</p>

					<p>
						ReactiveBackup allows Windows, MacOS, and Linux users to configure
						and run code backups for 1 to N repositories on your local machine.
						You can use the tool to run a quick ad hoc backup, or have it run
						backups automatically (it'll look for changes in
						<code>x</code> configured code folders within the last
						<code>y</code> number of configured minutes).
					</p>

					<p>
						I hope you like the solution and find it useful. If you find bugs (I
						am sure there are bugs—after all this thing was the product of a few
						vibe coding sessions) please report them at
						<a
							href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/issues"
							target="_blank"
							rel="noreferrer noopener"
							>https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/issues</a
						>. Otherwise, you're welcome to reach out to me with
						questions/comments.
