					<h2 id="the-book">The Book</h2>

					<p>
						Welcome! If you're here, you probably heard about this phenomenon
						called "Docs as Tests", which
						<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelrbsilva/">Manny Silva</a>
						coined and then went on to write the
						<em
							><a
								href="https://www.amazon.com/Docs-Tests-Resilient-Technical-Documentation/dp/0994169361/"
								>Docs as Tests</a
							></em
						>
						book.
					</p>

					<p>
						First off, let me be clear that I am not affiliated with the
						<em>Docs as Tests</em> book, but as a technical writer I read it and
						I
						<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24W3IKLHWG1S6/"
							>thought it was really cool and definitely worth reading</a
						>. (I can vouch for the Kindle version being well put together, but
						there is a paperback version as well—either way, it's worth your
						time!).
					</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>: I will try to make it extra clear
							where possible, but you can basically assume everything I am going
							to say in this post was either pulled directly from the Docs as
							Tests book or heavily inspired by it.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h2 id="the-promise">The Promise</h2>

					<p>
						After reading the <em>Docs as Tests</em> book, I am confident that
						the Docs as Tests discipline can solve <em>many</em> business
						problems related to documentation. In the book, Manny goes into
						great detail how <em>this</em> bit of tech can help you test with
						docs for <em>that</em> part of the stack.
					</p>

					<h2 id="the-goods">The Goods</h2>

					<p>
						However, if you're not a software engineer (or perhaps even if you
						are, as I was!), you might be intimidated by the amount of tools
						mentioned in the book. Some examples:
					</p>

					<figure class="post-figure">
						<img
							src="/src/content/blog/posts/post-images/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/dat1-testing-tools.png"
							alt="Testing tools diagram"
						/>
					</figure>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							NOTES:<br />* I added Pytest because I have used it for
							integration testing<br />** Doc Detective is kind of a unicorn in
							that it seems to be capable of testing in multiple areas
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						I did my best to break the tools down by test surface area, but I
						suspect some of these tools are more versatile (i.e. - they can test
						more areas) than the graphic would suggest.
					</p>

					<h2 id="and-you-showed-me-the-tools-why">
						And You Showed Me the Tools Why?
					</h2>

					<p>Oh, right I'm trying to make you <em>more</em> comfortable.</p>

					<p>
						First, before going anywhere with Docs as Tests, one helpful
						strategy is to
						<a href="https://youtu.be/SkpXpvTk6iU?si=wCqnfOazZm1OLhtj&amp;t=422"
							>redirect your overwhelm into curiosity</a
						>. Another way to put this is to acknowledge you are going to have
						"What the heck is <em>that</em>?" moments, and focus on the stuff
						that you <em>can</em> understand.
					</p>

					<p>
						Second, if there's one thing I learned as a developer it's that
						scope matters. A lot. Don't bite off more than you can chew!
					</p>

					<p>
						In the book, Manny suggests (and I agree completely) that you need
						to decide which areas (e.g. - UI, API, etc.) that you want to begin
						improving with documentation testing. (You might have multiple areas
						that can be improved, but you should start with a small win and go
						from there).
					</p>

					<h2 id="what-success-looks-like">What Success Looks Like</h2>

					<p>
						You may have already clocked it based on the tooling discussion
						above, but one frustrating thing about Docs as Tests is that a
						successful testing implementation for Company A might look very
						different from Company B's implementation. In other words, it
						depends on your environment and answers to questions like:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							Do your docs describe the behavior of a UI, an API, or both?
						</li>
						<li>Do you have code samples that developers can run?</li>
					</ul>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							<strong>NOTE</strong>: this isn't a complete list of guiding
							questions, but hopefully these are enough to get your docs testing
							gears turning.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Before going any further, I wanted to mention that Manny Silva
							recently showed off v3 of his
							<a href="https://doc-detective.com/">Doc Detective</a> tool in
							<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ4_1vBW_QY&amp;t=28s"
								>this video</a
							>, which includes some examples like the one I'm about to show.
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Although there is often a place for a deep dive showing how
						something works (stay tuned for more Docs as Tests content here), I
						also think there's value in distilling one potential approach down
						to a few screenshots. So let's begin!
					</p>

					<p>First, consider the sign-up page below for a product:</p>

					<figure class="post-figure">
						<img
							src="/src/content/blog/posts/post-images/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/dat1-signup-page.png"
							alt="Sign-up page screenshot"
						/>
					</figure>

					<p>
						Now suppose that we have the following documentation (in markdown)
						instructing end users how to sign up using this page:
					</p>

					<pre><code>1. Navigate to [Product Home](https://jtasse.github.io/docsastests-demo/index.html)

2. Enter your address in the **Email** field.

3. Enter a password in the **New Password** field.

4. Click **Create Account**.</code></pre>

					<p>Have you spotted the problem yet?</p>

					<p>No worries if not. Let's see what Doc Detective can find.</p>

					<pre class="error-output"><code>"result": "FAIL",
"resultDescription":
     "No elements matched selector or text.",
     "find": "<mark>Create Account</mark>",</code></pre>

					<p>
						Oh no, it looks like that blasted development team has done it
						again! As the above Doc Detective test result shows,
						<strong
							>the test failed because the text of the button on the product
							page no longer matches the documentation</strong
						>.
					</p>

					<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>

					<p>
						Isn't this cool?! OK, I hear you, failing tests are a bummer. But
						think about what this means (again, just repeating the logic from
						the <em>Docs as Tests</em> book):
					</p>

					<p class="highlight">
						<strong
							>You can use tools like Doc Detective to catch discrepancies
							between your product and docs before the product even
							releases!</strong
						>
					</p>

					<h2 id="and-from-the-devs-come-testing-riches">
						And from the devs come testing riches
					</h2>

					<blockquote>
						<p>
							DISCLAIMER: below is probably an oversimplification of how
							software testing works (and how messy it can be), but hopefully it
							communicates the power of what documentarians can now access
						</p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						Let me try to put the above revelation into a different context. I
						worked as a software developer for about 7 years. For probably every
						product I worked on, myself and other devs would write tests that
						would run every time a new change is introduced to the software.
					</p>

					<p>
						If a test failed, it meant that a developer had made a change that
						didn't play nice with some existing functionality. They broke
						something.
					</p>

					<p>
						I don't recall documentarians/technical writers ever having access
						to <em>anything</em> like that. Sure there are lots of tools to
						check spelling, grammar, style; and those are still important.
					</p>

					<p>
						But now technical writers armed with tests like the one I demoed
						above can say:
					</p>

					<blockquote class="pullquote">
						<p>Hey, dev team: <strong>you broke my docs*</strong></p>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						* you might want to say it a little nicer than that, as developers
						are people just trying to get their stuff done, too (see: the
						<a
							href="https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive"
							>Agile Prime Directive</a
						>)
					</p>

					<h2 id="whats-next">What's Next</h2>

					<p>
						If you're feeling brave, you can
						<a
							href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository"
							>clone</a
						>
						the
						<a href="https://github.com/jtasse/docsastests-demo/tree/main"
							>GitHub repository</a
						>
						that I used for the demo in this post.
					</p>

					<p>
						But fear not if you stopped learning about cloning with
						<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117108/">Multiplicity</a>
						(Michael Keaton's best work?). I intend to do a deeper dive into how
						Doc Detective (and maybe other testing tools) work in my next post.
					</p>

					<p>
						I also plan produce a related video or two, if that's more your
						speed.
					</p>

					<p>Until then, happy testing.</p>
