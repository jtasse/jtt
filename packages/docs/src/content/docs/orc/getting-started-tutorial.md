:::note[Learning Goal]
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to select a satellite, initiate a decommission sequence, and pause/resume or reset the scene.
:::

1. **Select a Target Satellite**

   Locate the `Available Satellites` list in the `Orbital Refuse Collector Demo` sidebar.

   Click on any satellite name (For example: `Leona` or `Moltar`).

   _Observe:_ A light blue box surrounds the selected satellite within the scene, and its details appear in the `Satellite Info` pane.

2. **Initiate Decommission**

   With a satellite selected, look at the `Actions` pane below the satellite list.

   Click the `Decommission Satellite` button.

   _Observe:_ The robotic hand activates and moves toward the target satellite before decommissioning it.

3. **Cancel the Operation**

   If you realize you have selected the wrong target or wish to stop the decommission for any reason, you can abort the process immediately.

   Locate the `Cancel Decommission` button.

   > **NOTE**: the `Decommission` button becomes the `Cancel Decommission` button once decommission is initiated.

   Click `Cancel Decommission`.

   _Result:_ The robotic hand disengages and the satellite returns to its operational state.

4. **Pause/Resume the Scene**

   Locate the `Pause/Resume Scene` button.

   At any time, you may click the `Pause/Resume Scene` button to freeze the scene.

   _Observe:_ The satellites and Hand of ORC stop moving. At this point you may rotate the camera freely and take screenshots.

   With the scene paused, click the `Pause/Resume Scene` button to start the scene from the state where it was before you paused it.

5. **Reset the Scene**

   If you would like restore the scene to its initial state, locate the `Reset Scene` button.

   Click `Reset Scene`.

   _Observe:_ Any satellites decommissioned during your current session will be restored to their original orbits.

## Conclusion

You have successfully learned how to:

- perform a satellite decommission
- cancel a satellite decommission
- pause and resume the scene
- reset the scene

You can repeat these steps for any satellite in the list to practice managing satellites in need of decommission.
