:::note[Learning Goal]
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to select a satellite, initiate a decommission sequence, and reset the operation.
:::

1. **Select a Target Satellite**

   Locate the **Available Satellites** list in the `Orbital Refuse Collector Demo` sidebar.

   Click on any satellite name (For example: `Leona` or `Moltar`).

   _Observe:_ A light blue box surrounds the selected satellite within the scene, and its details appear in the **Satellite Info** pane.

2. **Initiate Decommission**

   With a satellite selected, look at the **Actions** pane below the satellite list.

   Click the **Decommission Satellite** button.

   _Observe:_ The robotic hand activates and moves toward the target satellite before decommissioning it.

3. **Cancel the Operation**

   If you realize you have selected the wrong target or wish to stop the simulation, you can abort the process immediately.

   Locate the **Cancel Decommission** button.

   > **NOTE**: the `Decommission` button becomes the `Cancel Decommission` button once decommission is initiated.

   Click **Cancel Decommission**.

   _Result:_ The robotic hand disengages and the satellite returns to its operational state.

## Conclusion

You have successfully performed a satellite decommission and learned how to cancel the decommission operation. You can repeat these steps for any satellite in the list to practice managing satellites in need of decommission.
