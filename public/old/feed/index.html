<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background">Background</h2>



<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been working on some projects—including a complete reimagining of this very website—and as such I&#8217;ve been interacting with Git on a daily basis. At some point I ran into some conflicts (let&#8217;s call it <em>infighting</em>) between various code assistants (*glares at Copilot*) and the recurrence of some workspace troubles that I have encountered over the years. So I decided that a backup solution more robust than the *copy appropriate code folders to backup folder* approach I&#8217;ve been doing for years was needed.</p>



<p>On a related note, since I pivoted to technical writing full time in 2024; I&#8217;ve encountered a lot of folks that have been writing for years but have either been forced into the Docs as Code approach, or just want to get more comfortable with it. I get you, and I think I can help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gitting-gud">Gitting Gud</h2>



<p>OK, sorry for the pun, but it&#8217;s actually relevant here. </p>



<p>Before I get into the specifics of the backup solution, I wanted to address the elephant in the room: <strong>yes, if you&#8217;re comfortable with the redundancy that git provides when backing up your [pushed] code, then you don&#8217;t need an additional backup solution!</strong></p>



<p>To put that into technical terms, if you&#8217;re doing something like this&#8230;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git add .
git push origin main</code></pre>



<p>&#8230;then you&#8217;ve just backed up any tracked files to a remote repository. Sweet!</p>



<p>But. <em>But</em>—and this is where things get messy—there&#8217;s a lot that can happen before you push.</p>



<p>I mentioned coding assistants above, and I&#8217;ll pick on GitHub Copilot (a tool co-developed by OpenAI and Microsoft subsidiary GitHub) here. Copilot seems to take a different approach to other coding assistants that I&#8217;ve tried. I confess I don&#8217;t entirely understand the differences, but according to ChatGPT (lol): </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The short version: <strong>Copilot operates <em>inside</em> the editor’s text model</strong>, while tools like Claude Code and Gemini tend to operate <em>around</em> it. That difference makes Copilot uniquely capable of introducing destructive conflicts when you accept or reject suggestions.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Copilot can make edits even &#8220;before you explicitly accept them&#8221; (!).</p>



<p>This alone might be reason enough to look for a local code backup solution, but I&#8217;ll list a few more:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You want to push &#8220;meaty&#8221; commits that contain a full feature, bugfix, etc. rather than lots of little commits (see also: squashing commits is a pain :p)</li>



<li>You don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know, and just want the comfort of being able to manually revert files if something gets borked</li>



<li>You&#8217;re rebasing commits (and not fully comfortable with it)</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="existing-local-backup-solutions">Existing Local Backup Solutions</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that there are lots of existing backup tools out there. (I, for one, used the free version of <a href="http://fbackup.com">FBackup</a> for years). Although I think the propagation of free cloud backup services like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive have obviated the need for a lot of folks to run local backups; if you already use a local backup utility then this solution may be overkill.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="this-backup-solution">This Backup Solution</h2>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-3bdbd9ca565f4fd5774bc8b4086661e7">OK, I think we&#8217;re finally past the caveats <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f638.png" alt="😸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The particulars of my backup solution (I call it &#8220;ReactiveBackup&#8221;) can be found at <a href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup">https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/blob/main/README.md">README</a> file.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s a quick primer:</p>



<p>ReactiveBackup allows Windows, MacOS, and Linux users to configure and run code backups for 1 to N repositories on your local machine. You can use the tool to run a quick ad hoc backup, or have it run backups automatically (it&#8217;ll look for changes in <code>x</code> configured code folders within the last <code>y</code> number of configured minutes).</p>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-bb05970ef7c29ccf8b59e5ab7c5ff5f0">I hope you like the solution and find it useful. If you find bugs (I am sure there are bug<strong>s—</strong>after all this thing was the product of a few vibe coding sessions <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f639.png" alt="😹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />) please report them at <a href="https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/jtasse/ReactiveBackup/issues</a>. Otherwise, you&#8217;re welcome to reach out to me with questions/comments.</p>



<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-contrast-background-color has-background has-albert-sans-font-family">The Target</h2>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">In her nonfiction book <em>Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman&#8217;s OpenAI</em>, Karen Hao seeks to draw parallels between Old World empires like those of the British, French, &amp; Spanish and the company OpenAI while also examining how the company&#8217;s CEO Sam Altman has drawn from imperialist traditions. </p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">She begins with a dizzying sequence describing the temporary ouster of Sam Altman in from OpenAI in 2023 going back and tracing company&#8217;s chaotic rise. But for every supposed success of OpenAI, Hao points to the associated human and environmental costs. For example, she describes how &#8220;data annotation&#8221; workers in Kenya helped to filter out &#8220;violence and hate speech&#8221; from OpenAI models for &#8220;&#8221;starvation wages&#8221;. She also details the significant power needs of OpenAI data centers, at one point mentioning a planned data center campus that would require (as reported by <em>The Information</em>) &#8220;5,000 megawatts, nearly matching the average power demands of all of New York City.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">So I would say Ms. Hao makes her case about OpenAI acting like an empire (and Sam Altman acting like an emperor) pretty well. But she actually goes beyond this, exposing the suspect behaviors of Microsoft (Open AI&#8217;s partner/frenemy), Google, Anthropic (who were supposedly the good guys until they weren&#8217;t), Meta, and even X/Tesla/pick-your-favorite-Musk-venture. </p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">Hao is so relentless in describing the misbehavior of our beloved tech giants—yes even Google, who she points out twice tried to build water-hungry data centers in South American countries with severe drought—that I actually misremembered the name of the book as <em>Empire<strong>s</strong> of AI</em> (plural) and had to double-check it before writing this review.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-contrast-background-color has-background has-albert-sans-font-family">Core Values</h2>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">In a book full of great quotes, the author introduces arguably its most salient of them on page 3:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;…the most successful founders do not set out to create companies. They are on a mission to create something closer to a religion, and at some point it turns out that forming a company is the easiest way to do so.&#8221;</p>



<p>—Sam Altman, 2013</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">This quote immediately resonated with me, as I once worked for a company—I won&#8217;t name it, but I&#8217;m sure it wouldn&#8217;t be hard to figure out which one—that attracted me and hundreds (thousands?) of others on the strength of its <s>religion</s> culture. The company celebrated its core values constantly, and even awarded an &#8220;employee of the week&#8221; for the employee that best embodied one of the values for the given week. Even earlier in the company&#8217;s history, I was told of a crisis where employees remained so devoted to the company&#8217;s vision that they temporarily forewent their salaries while the company weathered a challenging cashflow situation.</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">So what happened to that company? Well, the problem was that they had record profits. *cough*, sorry. The problem was that they had record profits <em>and some overeager executives/private investors</em>, and this led them to make the &#8220;tough decision&#8221; to lay off dozens of people for the first time in the company&#8217;s history. I left the company shortly after the layoffs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-contrast-background-color has-background has-albert-sans-font-family">Not so Nonprofit</h2>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">In <em>Empire of AI</em>, Karen Hao recounts the earliest days of OpenAI, back when it was actually structured as a true nonprofit (<em>technically </em>OpenAI still has a nonprofit component, but as the book describes it the nonprofit arm of OpenAI is little more than decorative these days). She talks about how the founders, including Ilya Sutskever, Elon Musk, and Sam Altman truly believed in the idea of creating AGI (Artificial General Intelligence, or an AI system that can perform just about any task as well as a human) and leveraging it to benefit all of humanity. Someday, they believed, AGI could &#8220;solve climate change&#8221;, &#8220;cure diseases&#8221;, and usher in an era where everyone has access to UBI (universal basic income).</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">But here we are in 2025—ten years after OpenAI was founded and despite hundreds of billions of dollars invested—and what does OpenAI have to show for their efforts?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list has-albert-sans-font-family">
<li>No AGI</li>



<li>So many data centers that are <em>accelerating </em>climate change and, oh yeah, making our electric bills go up</li>



<li>0 diseases cured</li>



<li>No UBI</li>



<li>ChatGPT is kind of neat?</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-contrast-background-color has-background has-albert-sans-font-family">The Untainted Vision Economy</h2>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">There is a part of me that wants OpenAI to succeed, to give them a chance to make good on their original promise of spreading around a little prosperity to everyone. But I&#8217;m not holding my breath.</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">In <em>Empire of AI</em>, Karen Hao paints the &#8220;Safety&#8221; researchers—I&#8217;m thinking of &#8220;existential safety&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;trying to make sure AGI or superintelligence doesn&#8217;t kill us all—as the good guys. The prime example would be Dario Amodei, who, along with a number of like-minded folks, left OpenAI to found Anthropic amid concerns that OpenAI no longer truly cared about safety. However, Hao points out that over time Anthropic&#8217;s view of safety has become harder to distinguish from OpenAI&#8217;s.</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">This brings to mind a quote:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-albert-sans-font-family is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;All of this has happened before, and it will all happen again.&#8221;</p>



<p>-initially I recalled this from Battlestar Galactica (2004), but apparently it originated with J.M. Barrie&#8217;s Peter Pan (1954)</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">We cannot count on bold visions like the one that began with OpenAI to magically come to fruition of their own accord. In so many cases like that once-unicorn of a company where I worked, like with Google, and Microsoft, and well, America; the present reality has drifted far afield from the founding ideology. Both from internal pressures to succeed against the &#8220;other&#8221;, and external ones to grow and innovate at 10x the speed of the competition; entropy seems to push our psychological and economic systems in the wrong direction, practically by default.</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">But if we follow Karen Hao&#8217;s lead. If we call out the tech fiends on their bullshit. If we stop letting the Sam Altmans wriggle out of yet another ridiculous lie/prediction. If we stop the construction of another data center that will take our power, our water, and accelerate climate change. If we champion the usage of smaller, more lightweight AI models and use them instead of the gigantic language models like those powering ChatGPT.</p>



<p class="has-albert-sans-font-family">Then we just might be able to choose our own future (instead of AGI choosing it for us).</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The what-dash?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re like me, the em dash (<code>—</code>) represents an irresistible (lazy?) way to break up sentences. But, frustratingly, it&#8217;s not super easy to use in every context. For example, MS Word and Google Docs will automatically convert 2 en dashes (<code>--</code>) into an em dash. But what if you&#8217;re in Notepad or a browser?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Windows</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pure keystrokes (if you have a num pad)</h3>



<p>In Windows, you can insert an em dash by doing the following:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this solution requires  that you have a number pad on your keyboard</p>
</blockquote>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Hold down Alt</li>



<li>Type <code>0151</code></li>



<li>Release <code>Alt</code> </li>
</ol>

<p>You can also press Windows key + period  to bring up the &#8217;emoji and more&#8217; interface and insert an em dash via the &#8216;Symbols&#8217; tab. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Espanso</h3>



<p>These options are fine, if a bit gross. But if you&#8217;re open to installing the <a href="https://espanso.org/">espanso</a> app on Mac, Windows, or Linux, there is another way.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Steps</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Download <a href="https://espanso.org/install/">espanso</a> and install it.</li>



<li>Find out where the match configuration lives in your environment. </li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: in Windows, you can find it by navigating to <code><strong>%appdata%/espanso/match</strong></code> and opening <code><strong>base.yaml</strong></code>. I am not sure about where to configure matches for other operating systems, so see the <a href="https://espanso.org/docs/get-started/">docs</a> for those.</p>
</blockquote>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Within the base.yaml file, configure a match.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: below is the match config I am using, but you can use whatever you want (just be sure to avoid collisions with other keystrokes where possible)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 6/30/25</strong>: Here&#8217;s a copy/paste-friendly version of the config that you can add to your <code>base.yaml</code> file, with a entry for an en dash added as a bonus.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: apparently yaml (or VS Code reading yaml) doesn&#8217;t display em dashes differently from en dashes (as seen in the <code>replace</code> values below), but it does preserve the character information. <br><br>If you&#8217;d like to verify this yourself, you can copy the characters out of the yaml and paste them somewhere like Notepad or a browser.</p>
</blockquote>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>  ## Em dash
  - trigger: "---"
    replace: "—"

  ## En dash
  - trigger: "-+"
    replace: "–"</code></pre>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li style="padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">I described the promise of the <a href="https://www.docsastests.com/">Docs As Tests discipline</a> coined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuelrbsilva">Manny Silva</a> and borrowed liberally from Manny&#8217;s fantastic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Docs-Tests-Resilient-Technical-Documentation/dp/0994169361">book of the same name</a>.</li>



<li style="padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)">I then went on to categorize some of the tools mentioned in the book before encouraging documentarians to start thinking about what part(s) of their environment might benefit the most from a Docs as Tests implementation.</li>



<li>Finally, I presented a very simple <a href="https://jamestasse.tech/2025/05/29/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/#demo">demo</a> showing how Docs as Tests (and Manny&#8217;s <a href="https://doc-detective.com/">Doc Detective</a> tool, in this case) can catch a divergence between a product (a web application in this scenario) and the documentation intended to describe it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="intended-audience">Intended Audience</h2>



<p>My last post was very much focused on the business value of Docs as Tests and [hopefully] building some excitement in the minds of technical writers. But in this one my goal is to provide enough technical detail to whet the appetite of more technical folks (think developers, DocOps, etc.) while still bringing along those of you tech writers (or documentarians, if you prefer) that dared to dream after seeing the demo from last time.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s important I acknowledge that some documentarians write code and some software engineers write docs—I will do my best to meet you where you are!</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-approach">Technical Approach</h2>



<p>I fully admit that trying to create an instructional technical post for such a diverse set of readers is a bit like threading a needle, but I am going to try anyway <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So I&#8217;ll start with some suggestions as you read this post:</p>



<ul style="padding-top:0;padding-bottom:0" class="wp-block-list">
<li style="padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);line-height:1.5"><strong>For folks with <em>less </em>technical experience</strong>: this might feel a bit like onboarding at your last job (but hopefully more fun!), as I am going to introduce you to the tools, commands, etc. that you&#8217;ll need to run the demo from the <a href="https://jamestasse.tech/2025/05/29/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/">last post</a> (and more) yourself. If at any point you feel overwhelmed, that&#8217;s fine—you are welcome to <a href="mailto:james.tasse@gmail.com">email me</a> or take a break and come back in an hour, a day, or a week.</li>



<li style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);line-height:1.5"><strong><strong>For folks with <em>more </em>technical experience</strong></strong>: I&#8217;ll try to structure things so you can easily skip over sections you might know (e.g. &#8211; installing VS Code).</li>



<li style="margin-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);line-height:1.5"><strong>For <em>everyone</em></strong>: if you need help or have questions/feedback regarding this post; go ahead and <a href="mailto:james.tasse@gmail.com"></a><a href="mailto:james.tasse@gmail.com">email me</a> or leave a comment below. On the other hand, if your questions/feedback relate to Doc Detective, visit the Doc Detective <a href="https://discord.gg/2M7wXEThfF">Discord</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/doc-detective/posts/?feedView=all">LinkedIn</a> page.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="goals-for-this-post">Goals for this post</h2>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li style="padding-bottom:0">Discuss where the testing we&#8217;re doing fits with automated software tests</li>



<li>Install prerequisites</li>



<li>Run tests</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-are-we">Where Are We?</h2>



<p>Before getting into the technical stuff I want to paint a picture of where Docs as Tests <em>lives </em>in the software development and documentation space. If you have any familiarity with Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/topics/ci-cd/">CI/CD</a>), you&#8217;ve probably seen a diagram like the one below.</p>

<p>Basically, the software (and docs) development process goes from left to right . Now for our purposes, we want to focus on the <code>test</code> step.</p>

<p>A word of caution: this diagram is by no means a complete picture of all types of testing (especially on the software development side). Also, if you think about it too much you&#8217;ll see there&#8217;s a bit of an apples to oranges comparison going on<img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>It seems fair to say that software testing is more mature as a discipline than Docs as Tests—after all, it has been around for much longer. This is reflected in the diagram  above where I show the various flavors of software testing.</p>



<p>But Docs as Tests is catching up fast! When you look at the Venn diagram in the <code>Docs</code> section of the diagram, do you see anything familiar? You might recall (or not, which is fine!) how in the last post I shared <a href="https://jamestasse.tech/2025/05/29/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/#the-goods">an image listing some of the tools</a> we have available for testing various parts of our docs.</p>



<p>Below is that image [slightly altered for correctness/emphasis] again. The takeaway here is that despite Docs As Tests being the new  kid (compared to software testing), we already have lots of tools we can use for our tests!</p>

<p>All right, that&#8217;s enough mental positioning—let&#8217;s get your environment ready to do some testing!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t save the world without the right tools, especially a crowbar.</p><cite><a href="https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/Gordon_Freeman">Gordon Freeman</a> (probably)</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>I am going to list the tools that you&#8217;ll need and where to get them. I believe they are all available in Windows, Mac, and Linux environments, but <a href="mailto:james.tasse@gmail.com">let me know</a> if you run into issues and we&#8217;ll figure something out.</p>



<p>Also, I know that people might prefer different tools. For example, the newer Cursor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> has gained some popularity. Of course, if you are using a different IDE than VS Code, I suspect you already have the tools listed below (or equivalent) installed and can skip down to cloning my repo <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>OK, let&#8217;s get started.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tools">Tools</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Download and install <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a>.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Don&#8217;t be intimidated by the Git installer: it has many screens with different options (or at least the Windows one does), but the defaults ought to be fine in most cases. Like good defaults should be!</p>
</blockquote>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Download and install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</a> (or your preferred IDE)</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Download and install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a></li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>I can vouch for Node.js major version 22 working fine with the tools we will use in these tests, but thankfully you can install multiple versions of Node if you need to use an older version for some reason.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code">Code</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone">Clone</a> my <a href="https://github.com/jtasse/docsastests-demo">docsastests-demo</a> repository</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>This process will put a copy of my docsastests-demo repo on your machine. I&#8217;ll provide steps that should work in any environment.</p>
</blockquote>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Open a command prompt or terminal of some kind</li>



<li>Navigate to the directory where you want to store the code repository (note that this is totally arbitrary). I believe there are some slight differences in syntax depending on the OS and/or terminal, but let&#8217;s suppose you keep (or want to keep) your git projects within the <code>C:/git</code> directory. In this case you would run the command:</li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cd c:/git</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You&#8217;ll know you&#8217;re in the right place if you see something like following left of the blinking cursor in the terminal: </li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>c:\git&gt;</code></code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>OK, now go ahead  and copy the following command and run it in your terminal:</li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>git clone https://github.com/jtasse/docsastests-demo.git</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You should see <code>Cloning into 'docsastests-demo'…</code> and some other messages appear in your terminal. If there are no errors, you can move on to installing dependencies.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dependencies">Dependencies</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Dependencies are software (often referred to as <strong>packages</strong>) that we can include in a project if we don&#8217;t want to write the code for the corresponding functions ourselves. For example, since I do not want to write a tool that can auto-detect assertions in markdown and test them, we are going to install Doc Detective as a dependency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One nice thing about dependencies is that it is generally quite easy to install them once they are defined in your project.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Further reading: if you&#8217;d like to see the dependencies for the <code>docsastests-demo</code> repo (or any other node-based project), open the <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json">package.json</a> file at the root of the repo.</p>
</blockquote>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>OK, now open a terminal (or use an existing one) and navigate to the root of the now-cloned <code>docsastests-demo</code> repo. For example, if you put it in the location I used above, the command would be:</li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>cd C:\git\docsastests-demo</code></pre>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Tip: modern IDEs like VS Code tend to have built-in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/getting-started">terminal</a> functionality. Although it&#8217;s not required to use it, you might find that it cuts down on context-switching and helps you ensure you are in the right place (when running commands that are directory-sensitive)</p>
</blockquote>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Now run the following command:</li>
</ul>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>npm install</code></pre>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>You should see some activity in your terminal. This command can take a long time to run in bigger projects, but we only have a few packages so it shouldn&#8217;t take more than a couple minutes.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>NOTE: after the package install is complete you might see a message in your output that looks like this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>19 vulnerabilities (6 moderate, 13 high) </code></pre>



<p>Unless you plan on creating and releasing production software from your current project/code, these vulnerabilities won&#8217;t affect you. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f479.png" alt="👹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve installed all the stuff! However, before we jump into testing a quick tour of the project is in order. </p>



<p>You can think of <code>docsastests-demo</code> as a Frankenstein  application that has one purpose—helping you learning how Docs as Test-ing (ugh, I know) works. After you go through the demo you are free to copy it, extend it, or delete it as you see fit. But for now, here&#8217;s a reference image and corresponding docs for how things are laid out:</p>

                {
                  "result": "PASS",
                  "resultDescription": "Opened URL.",
                  "goTo": {
                    "url": "http://localhost:3000/"
                  },
                  "stepId": "67f92b95-bae1-4c15-b9b8-4d5f3c4030b6"
                }
</pre></div>


<p>Nice! With this test, Doc Detective:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Saw the URL in the first step of our <code>account-setup.md</code> file </li>



<li>Attempted to access the URL and succeeded</li>



<li>Reported a &#8220;PASS&#8221; result for this test</li>
</ol>



<p>Let&#8217;s look at the next test:</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
{
                  "result": "PASS",
                  "resultDescription": "Returned 200",
                  "checkLink": {
                    "url": "http://localhost:3000/"
                  },
                  "stepId": "9681b914-1cb4-42d2-8e9e-0af1d21602f6"
                }
</pre></div>


<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status">HTTP response codes</a>, a <code>200</code> means that the request has succeeded. To me, the previous test result (i.e. &#8211; successful navigation to a web page) seemingly renders this test unnecessary; but there could be a reason Doc Detective runs this test separately, and it is definitely not doing any harm!</p>



<p>Next!</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
                {
                  "outputs": {
                    "element": {
                      "text": "Email"
                    }
                  },
                  "result": "PASS",
                  "resultDescription": "Found an element matching selector. Found element by text.",
                  "find": "Email",
                  "stepId": "79fe9fb3-0843-4711-94fa-bc757493c9e5"
                }
</pre></div>


<p>This is an example of Doc Detective being quite clever. Here&#8217;s what it did:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Let&#8217;s start using DD as shorthand for Doc Detective, which delivers (at least) a double-dose of testin&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>DD saw that email in <code>account-setup.md</code> was wrapped in double-asterisks (so <code>**Email**</code>).</li>



<li>DD does not think (as far as I know?), but if it did, it made a note of the above and thought &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go and look for an email field on the product page&#8221; mentioned in step 1.</li>



<li>DD determined that the product page *indeed contained an email field, and reported that it &#8220;Found an element matching selector&#8221; (i.e. &#8211; <code>Email</code>)</li>



<li>Recorded a <code>PASS </code>result for this test</li>
</ol>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0832f1172bbf0ba41ba579afd4a3c181" style="color:#cfcb0e">*<strong>CAUTION</strong>: I wanted to call out here that Doc Detective appears to require a field label (in this case, <code>&lt;label for="email"&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;</code>) in order to pick up <code>Email</code> or other fields. If you are testing a web application and its syntax does not align with this approach then you might not be able to use DD autodetect in the relevant areas.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Next test.</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
{
                  "outputs": {
                    "element": {
                      "text": "New Password"
                    }
                  },
                  "result": "PASS",
                  "resultDescription": "Found an element matching selector. Found element by text.",
                  "find": "New Password",
                  "stepId": "7b331142-38da-46f3-b9ef-feef72202593"
                }
</pre></div>


<p>This test was very similar to the test for the Email field, with DD looking for a <code>New Password</code> field instead. It passed once DD found the following label in index.html: <code>&lt;label for="password"&gt;New Password&lt;/label&gt;</code></p>



<p>All right, we&#8217;ve made it to the last test of this particular demo!</p>


<div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "><pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
                {
                  "result": "FAIL",
                  "resultDescription": "No elements matched selector or text.",
                  "click": "Create Account",
                  "stepId": "d942f059-bb0c-4f6a-862f-d948d976538c"
                },
</pre></div>


<p>In this test, DD searched for an element with the text &#8220;Create Account&#8221;, but couldn&#8217;t find it. So the test failed.</p>



<p>In a real world example, this might manifest as the Development/Engineering team changing the text of a button without informing the Docs team that the corresponding documentation needed to be updated. But we have tests now, and we just caught it before the release! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I do see another <code>"Create Account not found"</code> failed test that appears identical to the one above. I am not sure why there is another one, but I am going to ignore it for now and move on.</p>

<p>OK, so Doc Detective found a discrepancy between the docs and the product. Awesome! But what happens next?</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s possible that the change in the product was a mistake, it&#8217;s probably more likely that the Product team wanted to change the button language to what it is now (i.e. &#8211; <code>Sign Up</code> instead of <code>Create Account</code>) and they just forgot to tell the Docs team. (I mean hopefully they forgot and it&#8217;s no all out war between departments! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f4a5.png" alt="💥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p>Accordingly, it would probably be a good idea for your Docs team to reach out to Product to confirm that this was indeed a misunderstanding. Let&#8217;s assume that it was, in which case there is no further action required by the Product or Engineering teams for this particular case.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Obviously if the Docs team is implementing Docs as Tests, at some point one would expect a dialogue between the Docs team and Product, Engineering, etc. That is outside the scope of this (already long) post, but Manny Silva&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Docs-Tests-Resilient-Technical-Documentation-ebook/dp/B0F1H97QSL/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0">Docs as Tests</a> book does a good job addressing it!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But now that we know what the &#8220;blessed&#8221; language from Product looks like, let&#8217;s go ahead and update our docs.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>First, open <code>readthedocs/docs/source/account-setup.md</code> in your IDE.</li>



<li>Now, on line 6 where it reads: <code>4. Click <strong>**Create Account**</strong></code>&#8230;</li>

<p>Up until now, our testing has been all about the UI. But I wanted to conclude this post by dipping into another area, and why not API testing?</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In this test we&#8217;ll use markdown-doctest to find an issue with one of our code snippets. As with our previous test, we&#8217;ll fix the issue (this time in our code snippet) and verify our test passes.</p>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>All right, since we don&#8217;t need a local web server for this test, you can (optionally) stop the Node server you ran in the previous test by opening the terminal where it&#8217;s running and pressing <code>CTRL + C</code>.</li>

<p>The output here is a bit misleading on account of some combination of A) the JavaScript I told Copilot to write for our snippet and B) the expected usage for markdown-doctest. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60f.png" alt="😏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> But that&#8217;s OK, as we can still get a meaningful result. As I&#8217;ve highlighted below, the test reported that it encountered an HTTP response code of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/404">404</a> (not found) when trying to do a <code>fetch</code> from the endpoint at <code>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todoz/1</code>.</p>

<p>Look, no 404! Essentially, we just verified that after fixing a typo in one of our code snippets, the test suite is now able to reach the correct endpoint without errors. And because we caught it before the docs were released, we didn&#8217;t have to hear about the developers who called Support asking why their TODOz apps weren&#8217;t working. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f602.png" alt="😂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Great job! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-now">What now?</h2>



<p>Since you&#8217;ve now tested a UI and API using different tools, you can officially say you have Docs as Tests experience in those areas <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> And seriously, give yourself credit for all of the work it took to get here. Last I checked, the widget that indicates &#8220;reading time&#8221; for this post was at 20 minutes, but I suspect it took you at least 2-3 times make it through all of that setup and testing (probably more for the less technical folks <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1fae1.png" alt="🫡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />).</p>



<p>But obviously it doesn&#8217;t end here. For my part, I&#8217;m going to move on to making a video that covers this and the last post. I know some people vibe with learning from videos more than reading, and I also have a large video-shaped hole in my portfolio <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1fae4.png" alt="🫤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="code-coverage">Code Coverage</h3>



<p>After that, there is a topic that I think deserves some attention: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/software-testing/code-coverage">code coverage</a>. You&#8217;ve probably noticed that I have a strong preference for running tests that are auto-detected using tools like Doc Detective. Aside from the fact that these tests have high return on investment, they also scale with your docs automatically.</p>



<p>However, if code coverage of documentation-based tests is taken into account, it becomes easier for us to have confidence that we are &#8220;covering&#8221; all of our products with these tests. And, crucially, this can help us prevent our hand-crafted tests from becoming out of sync with our docs.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s it for now. Follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtasse/">LinkedIn</a> if you&#8217;d like to be notified when I publish a video or another blog post. </p>



<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="the-promise">The Promise</h2>



<p>After reading the <em>Docs as Tests</em> book, I am confident that the Docs as Tests discipline can solve <em>many </em>business problems related to documentation. In the book, Manny goes into great detail how <em>this </em>bit of tech can help you test with docs for <em>that </em>part of the stack.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="the-goods">The Goods</h2>



<p>However, if you&#8217;re not a software engineer (or perhaps even if you are, as I was!), you might be intimidated by the amount of tools mentioned in the book. Some examples:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default wp-duotone-unset-1"><img loading="lazy" width="842" height="222" data-attachment-id="912" data-permalink="https://jamestasse.tech/2025/05/29/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/testing_tools-5/" data-orig-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png" data-orig-size="842,222" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Testing_Tools" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=842" src="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=842" alt="" class="wp-image-912" srcset="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png 842w, https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=150 150w, https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=300 300w, https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/testing_tools-4.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></figure>

<p>I did my best to break the tools down by test surface area, but I suspect some of these tools are more versatile (i.e. &#8211; they can test more areas) than the graphic would suggest.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-left" id="and-you-showed-me-the-tools-why">And You Showed Me the Tools Why?</h2>



<p>Oh, right I&#8217;m trying to make you <em>more </em>comfortable <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-9f1bf7ba72db702c579bdaa26f23195c">First, before going anywhere with Docs as Tests, one helpful strategy is to <a href="https://youtu.be/SkpXpvTk6iU?si=wCqnfOazZm1OLhtj&amp;t=422">redirect your overwhelm into curiosity</a>. Another way to put this is to acknowledge you are going to have &#8220;What the heck is <em>that</em>?&#8221; moments, and focus on the stuff that you <em>can </em>understand.</p>



<p>Second, if there&#8217;s one thing I learned as a developer it&#8217;s that scope matters. A lot. Don&#8217;t bite off more than you can chew!</p>



<p>In the book, Manny suggests (and I agree completely) that you need to decide which areas (e.g. &#8211; UI, API, etc.) that you want to begin improving with documentation testing. (You might have multiple areas that can be improved, but you should start with a small win and go from there).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-success-looks-like">What Success Looks Like</h2>



<p>You may have already clocked it based on the tooling discussion above, but one frustrating thing about Docs as Tests is that a successful testing implementation for Company A might look very different from Company B&#8217;s implementation. In other words, it depends on your environment and answers to questions like:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Do your docs describe the behavior of a UI, an API, or both? </li>



<li>Do you have code samples that developers can run?</li>
</ul>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: this isn&#8217;t a complete list of guiding questions, but hopefully these are enough enough to get your docs testing gears turning <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2699.png" alt="⚙" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="demo">Demo</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-967dfac0d978bed03e8214ebe89ae7fe">Before going any further, I wanted to mention that Manny Silva recently showed off v3 of his <a href="https://doc-detective.com/">Doc Detective</a> tool in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ4_1vBW_QY&amp;t=28s">this video</a>, which includes some examples like the one I&#8217;m about to show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although there is often a place for a deep dive showing how something works (stay tuned for more Docs as Tests content here), I also think there&#8217;s value in distilling one potential approach down to a few screenshots. So let&#8217;s begin!</p>



<p>First, consider the sign-up page below for a product: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="575" data-attachment-id="915" data-permalink="https://jamestasse.tech/2025/05/29/docs-as-tests-on-a-high-level/image-2/" data-orig-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png" data-orig-size="555,575" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png?w=290" data-large-file="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png?w=555" src="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png?w=555" alt="" class="wp-image-915" srcset="https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png 555w, https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png?w=145 145w, https://jamestasse.tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-1.png?w=290 290w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /></figure>



<p>Now suppose that we have the following documentation (in markdown) instructing end users how to sign up using this page:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>1. Navigate to &#091;Product Home](https://jtasse.github.io/docsastests-demo/index.html)

2. Enter your address in the **Email** field.

3. Enter a password in the **New Password** field.

4. Click **Create Account**.</code></pre>



<p>Have you spotted the problem yet? <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f914.png" alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>No worries if not. Let&#8217;s see what Doc Detective can find.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-18fce643e2c1af687f00b6fe82e0ad5d" style="color:#c51616"><code>"result": "FAIL",
"resultDescription": 
     "No elements matched selector or text.",    
     "find": "<strong><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);color:#9c2a9e" class="has-inline-color">Create Account</mark></strong>",</code></pre>



<p>Oh no, it looks like that blasted development team has done it again! <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f92c.png" alt="🤬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> As the above Doc Detective test result shows, <strong>the test failed because the text of the button on the product page no longer matches the documentation</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-what">So what?</h2>



<p>Isn&#8217;t this cool?! OK, I hear you, failing tests are a bummer. But think about what this means (again, just repeating the logic from the <em>Docs as Tests</em> book): </p>



<p class="has-background" style="background-color:#8328eb"><strong>You can use tools like Doc Detective to catch discrepancies between your product and docs before the product even releases! </strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="and-from-the-devs-come-testing-riches">And from the devs come testing riches</h2>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>DISCLAIMER: below is probably an oversimplification of how software testing works (and how messy it can be), but hopefully it communicates the power of what documentarians can now access</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Let me try to put the above revelation into a different context. I worked as a software developer for about 7 years. For probably every product I worked on, myself and other devs would write tests that would run every time a new change is introduced to the software.</p>



<p>If a test failed, it meant that a developer had made a change that didn&#8217;t play nice with some existing functionality. They broke something.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t recall documentarians/technical writers ever having access to <em>anything </em>like that. Sure there are lots of tools to check spelling, grammar, style; and those are still important.</p>



<p>But now technical writers armed with tests like the one I demoed above can say:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Hey, dev team: <strong>you broke my docs*</strong></p></blockquote></figure>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-72e6ee8ee10dcf03b15a7ecca39b594b">* you might want to say it a little nicer than that, as developers are people just trying to get their stuff done, too (see: the <a href="https://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive">Agile Prime Directive</a>)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-s-next">What&#8217;s Next</h2>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-361a1bd041116d9d70f8664dcd668cf1">If you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository">clone</a> the <a href="https://github.com/jtasse/docsastests-demo/tree/main">GitHub repository</a> that I used for the demo in this post.</p>



<p class="has-link-color wp-elements-1ed2c5905605b4a29a0584c330e61a62">But fear not if you stopped learning about cloning with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117108/">Multiplicity</a> (Michael Keaton&#8217;s best work?). I intend to do a deeper dive into how Doc Detective (and maybe other testing tools) work in my next post.</p>



<p>I also plan produce a related video or two, if that&#8217;s more your speed.</p>



<p>Until then, happy testing. <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f60e.png" alt="😎" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
